# Code Style Guidelines

Focus on code style during code review. Make the code style comments priority P2,
and make as many of them as necessary. Use succinct language in the comments.

Find language-specific style guidelines in the `ai_guidelines` folder.

Exceptions from the guidelines:
- We allow direct function imports from `tests.helpers_resolvers` and `tests.resolvers.video.helpers` in Python
- We allow direct function import from `typing` in Python
