# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural design documents, proposals, and decision records for Lightly Studio.

## Documents

### Proposals

- [API Refactoring: Hide Collection Hierarchy](./api-refactoring-collection-hierarchy.md) - Proposal to hide internal collection structure from the API, providing a cleaner dataset-centric interface

## Document Types

### Proposals
Design proposals for significant changes to the system architecture. These documents outline:
- Current state and problems
- Proposed solution
- Benefits and trade-offs
- Implementation strategy
- Migration path

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Once proposals are approved and implemented, they can be converted to ADRs documenting the decision, context, and consequences.
